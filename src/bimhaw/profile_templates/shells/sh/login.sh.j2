# non-login+interactive (NL+I) shells started from here will source
# that in addition to this.

# this script sets interactive specific things:
# - aliases
# - prompt customization

# many interactive specific options are shell specific (i.e. not POSIX
# or other standard shell) with the exception of aliases.
